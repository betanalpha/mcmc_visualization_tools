A collection of functions for visualizing Markov chain Monte Carlo output in
`R` with the base graphics library and `python` with `matplotlib`.  While the
functions are relatively general they are designed to facilitate the
implementation of Bayesian inference, including visual prior checks, visual
posterior retrodictive checks, and the visualization of marginal posterior
inferences.
